i have arduino - battery 9v - breadboard small - DC motor - transistor - wires for connecting
1- first i connect the battery 9v by breadboard small
2- The negative terminal is connected to the Arduino -GND- and the NPN is connected to the positive terminal, the dc motor is connected to the negative terminal and the other wire is connected to the NPN
3- Connecting the NPN from the left to the positive part and connecting it from the middle to the Arduino (-3)
